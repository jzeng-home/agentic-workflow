       "- **Dimensional Accuracy**: Parts typically achieve a dimensional accuracy of ±0.3%, with a lower limit of ±0.3%. ([tempus3d.com](https://www.tempus3d.com/hp-multi-jet-fusion-design-guide?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Build Volume**: The maximum printable size is 284 x 380 x 380 mm. For larger parts, consider splitting them into smaller components for post-print assembly. ([tempus3d.com](https://www.tempus3d.com/hp-multi-jet-fusion-design-guide?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Wall Thickness**: Minimum supported wall thickness is 0.4 mm; unsupported walls should be at least 0.5 mm to prevent warping and ensure structural integrity. ([tempus3d.com](https://www.tempus3d.com/hp-multi-jet-fusion-design-guide?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Feature Size**: Smallest printable features include hole diameters of 0.5 mm, shaft diameters of 0.5 mm, and embossed or engraved text with a minimum font size of 6 pt. ([xometry.pro](https://xometry.pro/en/articles/mjf-design-guidelines/?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Clearance**: For moving parts or assemblies, a minimum clearance of 0.6 mm is recommended to prevent fusion during printing. ([tempus3d.com](https://www.tempus3d.com/hp-multi-jet-fusion-design-guide?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Escape Holes**: Hollow parts should incorporate escape holes (minimum 4.0 mm diameter) to facilitate powder removal, preventing residual material from affecting part quality. ([tempus3d.com](https://www.tempus3d.com/hp-multi-jet-fusion-design-guide?utm_source=openai))\n",
